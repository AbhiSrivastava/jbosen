# JBösen

JBösen is a library for writing data-parallel machine learning applications. It provides a key-value storage interface implemented using a parameter server architecture, and fully supports the stale-synchronous parallel consistency model. For more information about JBösen, please see the [documentation](http://docs.petuum.com/projects/petuum-jbosen). JavaDoc-style documentation can be found [here](http://petuum.github.io/jbosen/javadoc/index.html).

JBösen is derived from our C++ project, [Bösen](https://github.com/petuum/bosen).
