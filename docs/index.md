JBösen is a Java version of the Petuum Bösen C++ project. Compared to C++ Bösen, JBösen is simplified in both its interface and implementation. It is intended as an easy starting point for developers who want to write programs on Bosen, or who are unable to use C++ for various reasons.

If you are more familiar with developing applications on Bösen in C++, or if you are only looking to run pre-built high-performance ML applications, please obtain the [C++ version](http://github.com/petuum/bosen) instead.
